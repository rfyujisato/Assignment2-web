Welcome to the final project for Web Development
This project was made by:
Santiago Mesa, Nicolas Mesa, Rafael Yuji Sato, Bruno Quinzan.

Project name: WatchNext
This is a web page that allow users to search movies and shows and store it in their profile.
You can search movies and shows even if you dont have an account.

We accomplish this by using an API Requets to obtain a JSON that have the data of the different movies 
and shows that are related to the search. Thanks to this, you can have acces to thousands of movies and shows,
the data is taken from the web of the api omdbapi.com. This is a open movie database and is open sourced.

The page has the functionality to open an account with email, username and password and once you have one, you can sign in with the 
corresponding user name and password you provided.

Once you are signed in, you can search movies and shows and it will enable you to add them to your profile.
You can see what movies and shows you have saved to your profile. It will display the poster, title and rating
of the movie or show you selected. Once again, all this data is retrieved by the API and by decoding and accesing the JSON data.
It will also let you delete a movie or show if you want to.

The project was developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript to give style and order to the front end. The backend 
and connections to the server side is coded in PHP. It includes the ddl statements to create the database and 
tables to be able to store information. Be sure you have the user "root" in the server "localhost" without a password.
